"""Escape hatch for PySide6's builtins.__import__ replacement.

PySide6 replaces builtins.__import__ with its own wrapper as soon as it is
imported, to support the `from __feature__ import ...` compatibility syntax
(unused by this project). Left in place for a later import, that wrapper
corrupts six's synthetic module machinery the first time pandas is imported
(pulled in transitively by the optional qwen-asr package), breaking
transformers with a misleading "cannot import name 'GenerationMixin'" error.

The GUI entry point captures the true, unpatched import function here before
PySide6 ever loads. Code that needs to import something through the
unpatched import machinery can request it via UsingOriginalImport(); outside
the GUI (nothing captured) this is a no-op, since nothing patched __import__
in the first place.
